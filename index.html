  <h1>(Super Late) Homework 3!</h1>
<p>Jennifer Fullerton || jfullert@ucsc.edu</p>
  <p>I only managed to get Part B done.  I have really, really learned my lesson of "finished > perfect"
   because I kept trying to make it better and it just...wouldn't get better.</p>
  <p>Color changes based on time, and makes use of drawing, merging, blending, rotating, and translating SDF shapes.</p>

  <h1>Homework 2!</h1>
  <p>Part A is good, Part B is a bit more stylish now!</p>

<h1>Past stuff: Homework 1</h1>
  <p>Part A is...not fully working, but Parts B and C are.  Also I apologize for my lack-of-CSS fashion-crimes on this page.</p>
