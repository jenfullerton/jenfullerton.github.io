 Part A is a "natural" scene where the terrain is made using Perlin noise, and where the height of each of the mountains
 also determines which texture is being used to color the hills.  There is also a reflective "sea," a skybox, and some controls
 to alter the terrain.
 
 Part B is so far the minimum submission requirements.  It is just a particle system and some point sprites, with some ability
 to adjust color.  The colors are now rainbow and the starting scene/camera position is set up so the viewer has one of the better views to start.
