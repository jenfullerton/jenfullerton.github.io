 Part A is a "natural" scene where the terrain is made using Perlin noise, and where the height of each of the mountains
 also determines which texture is being used to color the hills.  There is also a reflective "sea," a skybox, and some controls
 to alter the terrain.
 
 Part B is so far the minimum submission requirements.  It is just a particle system and some point sprites, with some ability
 to adjust color.  I will be adding some functionality to adjust the colors in a more deliberate fashion, and also (hopefully)
 have the sprites all react to music.
